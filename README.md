**Summary** This repository includes source data for BioSCAN and ButterflySCAN surveys, as well as processed data from iNaturalist. Two folders are included in the repository, `data` and `scripts` and one is implied `output` but not under version control (i.e. to run much of the code, a top-level directory called `output` should be created). Also included are RMarkdown-formatted (.Rmd) files with brief reports on various metrics and comparisons performed for this study.
